# Project 3 - *Yelp*

**Yelp** is a Yelp search app using the [Yelp API](http://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v2/search_api).

Time spent: **10** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] Table rows for search results should be dynamic height according to the content height. (3pt)
- [x] Custom cells should have the proper Auto Layout constraints. (+5pt)
- [x] Search bar should be in the navigation bar (doesn't have to expand to show location like the real Yelp app does). (+2pt)

The following **stretch** features are implemented:

- [x] Infinite scroll for restaurant results. (+3pt)
- [ ] Implement map view of restaurant results. (+3pt)
- [ ] Implement the restaurant detail page. (+2pt)

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. Infinite scrolling was definitely a challenging part of this assignment. I would like to discuss more about how to properly implement infinite scrolling.
2. I would also like to discuss what sorts of resources classmates find helpful when working with these assignments and labs.

## Video Walkthrough

Here's a walkthrough of implemented user stories:

## Notes

Auto layout has definitely been a challenge. When first adding constraints, the constraint lines were red. I started over and the newly added constraints were blue. Other times I would add a constraint, and it would be aligned to the margin, not the nearest element as I had expected. There was a lot of starting over and re-doing constraints. I do believe I am understanding more about constraints and auto layout with this additional practice.
